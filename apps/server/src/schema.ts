/**
 * The database schema, and the one guard that lets a breaking change be a refusal instead
 * of a silent misread.
 *
 * Two rules govern changes here, and they cover different things:
 *
 * - **Adding** a column goes through `ensureColumn` in `db.ts`. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
 *   EXISTS` skips tables that already exist, so a database created before the column
 *   would never gain it, and the additive change would apply to new installs only.
 * - **Changing what an existing column means** bumps `SCHEMA_VERSION`. No missing column
 *   can signal that, so without a version an old file is simply opened and read wrong —
 *   paths that resolve to the wrong directory, rows whose ids refer to a different kind of
 *   thing — with no error anywhere to explain it.
 *
 * `SCHEMA_VERSION` is deliberately the only history that survives a break: the file at a
 * refused version is left exactly as it was.

/**
 * Every table, with the columns that earlier releases added by migration folded back in.
 *
 * That folding is why this file can be read as the schema rather than as the schema plus a
 * pile of corrections. It is safe because a database from before the version guard can
 * never reach this code (see below), so there is nothing to upgrade in place.
 *
 * `copilots.model` is gone rather than dormant: it was superseded by `settings.modelId` and
 * only existed to be folded forward by a migration that no longer runs.

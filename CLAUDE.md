# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**guided-learning** is a self-hosted, single-user agent product (Browser/Server
architecture). It provides a chatbox-like UI over a manual ReAct agent loop with
tool calling. Three apps share a types package:

- `apps/server` — Fastify 5 + better-sqlite3 + LangChain.js (`@langchain/core`,
  `@langchain/openai`). Runs the agent loop, streams results over SSE, and serves
  the built frontend when there is one.
- `apps/web` — Vue 3 (Composition API) + Pinia + Vite. Renders the chat UI.
- `apps/desktop` — Electron. A "control panel" that starts/stops the server and opens
  the app, packaged as a Mac `.dmg` for people who do not want a terminal. Supervises
  the server as a child process; reimplements none of it. See `docs/desktop.md`.
- `packages/shared` — dependency-free API/domain types used by both sides.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install           # first time — see "Gotchas" below
pnpm dev               # run server + web together (backend :3720, web :5173)
pnpm dev:server        # tsx watch src/index.ts (backend only)
pnpm dev:web           # vite (frontend only)
pnpm typecheck         # tsc (server) + vue-tsc (web) + the e2e specs
pnpm test              # vitest: unit + integration (server + web), no network
pnpm test:coverage     # the same, with a coverage report (see "Testing")
pnpm test:e2e          # playwright: real browser + real server + a fake LLM
pnpm build             # production build of the web app
pnpm desktop:dev       # bundle and launch the Electron control panel
pnpm desktop:package   # build a Mac .dmg (apps/desktop/release/)
```

TypeScript is strict (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `isolatedModules`,
`moduleResolution: Bundler`, ESM). Run `pnpm typecheck` before finishing; a
clean typecheck is the bar for "done".

### Typecheck workaround

`pnpm typecheck` can be blocked by a host-level pnpm supply-chain policy
(`ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION`) shortly after packages like
`@langchain/core` are published. This is transient (resolves within a day) and
is not a code problem. To typecheck without hitting the policy, invoke the
binaries directly:

```bash
( cd apps/server && ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit )
( cd apps/web    && ./node_modules/.bin/vue-tsc --noEmit )
```

## Testing

**Every change ships with tests.** New behaviour needs a test that fails without it; a bug
fix needs a regression test that fails on the old code. `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck`
must both be clean — CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces it, so a red run is not
mergeable. The whole suite is offline: no API keys, no network.

```bash
pnpm test              # vitest, both apps (~670 tests, a few seconds)
pnpm test:watch        # same, in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # with a report; HTML lands in coverage/
pnpm test:e2e          # playwright (needs: pnpm exec playwright install chromium)
```

### Where tests live

| Path | What belongs there |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/server/test/` | unit + integration, mirroring `src/` |
| `apps/web/test/` | unit tests for utils, the API client, the composables and the Pinia store (jsdom) |
| `apps/web/test/i18n/` | catalog and hardcoded-text guards (see below) |
| `apps/desktop/test/` | the control panel's paths, launch spec, process supervision and catalogs |
| `e2e/*.spec.ts` | browser flows against the real stack |

Each app's `tsconfig` includes its `test/` directory, so **`pnpm typecheck` checks the
tests too**. For `apps/web` that also means `pnpm build` (which runs `vue-tsc`) fails on a
test type error. That is deliberate.

### Testing the agent without a model

Never call a real provider from a test. `apps/server/test/helpers/fakeLlm.ts` is a
scriptable OpenAI-compatible server: point a provider's `baseURL` at it and the *real*
`ChatOpenAI` → `createReasoningFetch` → `runAgentStream` → SSE route path runs end to end,
deterministically and offline.

```ts
const llm = await startFakeLlm();
const env = await startTestServer({ providers: [providerFor(llm)] });
llm.setTurns([{ reasoning: "hmm", content: "the answer" }]);
// …POST to /api/sessions/:id/chat via env.server.app.inject() and parse the SSE frames
```

It also runs standalone (`pnpm --filter @guided-learning/server fake-llm`), which is how
the Playwright suite scripts it over HTTP.

`apps/server/test/helpers/fakeParser.ts` is the same idea for document parsing: a
scriptable stand-in that speaks all three cloud-parser protocols (`sync` multipart,
MinerU's presigned-upload-and-poll, LlamaParse's multipart-and-poll), so the *real*
drivers run — presigned `PUT`, job polling, ZIP extraction, Bearer auth, error mapping —
with no account at any vendor. It runs standalone too
(`pnpm --filter @guided-learning/server fake-parser`), and the Playwright harness starts
one so the cloud fallback is exercised in a browser.

Reuse these rather than re-inventing them:

- `startTestServer()` — a real server on a **throwaway temp directory**; never the repo's
  `data/` or `workspaces/`.
- `parseSse()` / `eventTypes()` — SSE transcript → typed events, mirroring the browser
  client's parser.
- `providerFor(llm)` / `keylessProvider()` — provider records with and without a key.

### Testing the HTTP layer

`app.inject()` captures a hijacked SSE response in full (status, headers and body), so
route and chat tests need no port and no network — see
`apps/server/test/chat-sse.test.ts`. Use a real `listen({ port: 0 })` only when a browser
is the client.

### Testing the i18n catalogs

`apps/web/test/i18n/` is a set of guards rather than feature tests, and adding a string
means satisfying all of them:

- **`catalog.test.ts`** — key symmetry both ways, no empty values, no untranslated Chinese
  left in `en.ts`, placeholder parity across plural branches, a message for every
  `ApiErrorCode`/`ParseErrorCode`, every statically-written key resolves, and no dead keys.
  Keys built by concatenation are recognised by their trailing dot and matched against an
  explicit dynamic-prefix allowlist — keep that list narrow, since a broad prefix is where
  a typo hides.
- **`no-hardcoded-text.test.ts`** — fails on a user-facing CJK string anywhere outside
  `src/locales/`. Mark a legitimate exception with a `// i18n-exempt: <reason>` line
  comment, on the line or the one above; `grep -rn "i18n-exempt" apps/web/src` should
  return exactly one file. If it returns more, the guard is being routed around.

Tests that assert on wording must **pin the locale** (`i18n.global.locale.value = "zh-CN"`)
rather than inherit jsdom's `en-US` navigator — otherwise they pass against the English
catalog, which is a test passing for the wrong reason.

In Playwright, `locale: "zh-CN"` is pinned on the project in `playwright.config.ts`, so
every spec renders Chinese and inherits the pin. `e2e/i18n.spec.ts` is the only place the
other locales are exercised, and it scopes its `test.use({ locale })` overrides to its own
`describe` blocks.

### What is deliberately *not* unit tested

The Vue components. The Playwright suite covers them, which is why the Vitest coverage
config excludes `*.vue` — a browser run's coverage cannot be merged into that report, so
counting them there would only produce a number nobody acts on. Add a `data-testid` to any
component a flow needs to select.

## Reference project: chatbox

This app is modeled on [chatbox](https://github.com/chatboxai/chatbox) (Electron
+ React). A clone kept for reference lives at
`/Users/waychan23/Documents/work/spaces/trae/chatbox` — treat it as a
behavioral/UX reference only (chatbox is React/Electron; guided-learning is
Vue/Fastify), so port ideas rather than copy code. Quick map:

- `src/renderer/` — chat UI, settings, Copilot/agent config screens
- `src/renderer/packages/web-search/` — keyless Bing + DuckDuckGo scraping
- `packages/chatbox-core/src/models/` — model/provider adapters
- `packages/chatbox-core/src/generation/` — agent/tool (ReAct) loop
- `features/*.feature` — higher-level feature specs

Fuller map in `docs/reference.md`.

## Invariants worth respecting

- **Workspace sandboxing is a security boundary.** All file-tool paths MUST go
  through `resolveInWorkspace` (rejects `..` escapes and absolute escapes) and
  never operate outside the active workspace directory. Do not add a file tool
  that bypasses this.
- **Uploads are sandboxed too.** Attachment paths go through `resolveStoredPath`
  over `data/uploads/`, and stored files are located by directory listing rather
  than by anything the client claims. Uploads live outside the workspace on
  purpose, so chat attachments never show up in the agent's `list_files`.
- **`web_fetch` SSRF guard is a security boundary.** It is the only tool that
  makes the server issue an arbitrary outbound request. Keep the scheme check,
  the check on *every DNS-resolved address*, and the manual per-hop redirect
  re-validation. Do not "simplify" it to `redirect: "follow"`.
- **API keys never leave the server.** `PublicConfig` (from `/api/config`) and
  every provider response has only `hasApiKey: boolean`, never the key. A `PUT`
  with no `apiKey` field means "leave unchanged" — that is what lets the UI edit a
  provider it cannot read the key of.
- **Shared types only.** Cross-boundary payloads live in `packages/shared`. Adding
  a field to an API response means updating the type there first, then both apps
  typecheck clean.
- **No user-facing string is hardcoded.** Every visible label, tooltip,
  `placeholder`, `aria-label` and `title` comes from `t()` and a key in
  `apps/web/src/locales/`. The catalogs are `zh-CN.ts` (source of truth, typed)
  and `en.ts` (typed as that schema, so `pnpm typecheck` fails on a missing key).
  Keys are **domain-first** (`chat.titleHint`, `tools.name.write_file`), never
  keyed by component file — components get split and renamed. Non-component
  modules (`stores/app.ts`, `utils/minimap.ts`, `composables/confirm.ts`)
  translate through `i18n.global.t`, not `useI18n()`.
- **Icons come from the shared set; typographic characters do not.** Every mark in the
  UI is `<Icon name="…">`, drawn from `utils/icons.ts` — a 16×16 grid, stroked,
  `currentColor`, never a character and never an emoji. What stays a character is what
  is genuinely *content*: `AI` and product names, the SI unit symbols in
  `utils/format.ts` (B/KB/MB/GB, k/M), and the `→` / `·` separators the copy is built
  from. The split is not a preference. An emoji is painted by a colour font and
  **ignores `color`**, which made `.icon-btn.danger:hover` a rule that worked on the
  dialog close buttons and silently did nothing on the delete buttons beside them; and a
  glyph inside a translated sentence cannot be sized, coloured or aligned, which is how
  `✓ Key configured` lived in the catalog while the same idea in `ModelSelector` carried
  no mark. The server's `⚠️ ` on a failed turn is persisted into history and replayed to
  the model — content, not chrome, on the same boundary as the untranslated tool strings.
  `apps/web/test/icons.test.ts` enforces all of this.
- **`en` plural messages use `|`; `zh-CN` ones do not.** Both catalogs take the
  same call shape — `t(key, named, plural)` — so no component branches on the
  locale. A message containing a literal `|` must escape it as `{'|'}` or it
  becomes a plural branch. No message carries HTML: the two templates that need
  markup split the sentence into fragments and wrap them in real elements, so
  there is nothing for `v-html` to inject.
- **Server errors travel as `{ error: { code, message, params? } }`.** `code` is
  canonical and drives the client's wording (`ApiErrorCode` or `ParseErrorCode`
  from `packages/shared`); `message` is the server's own sentence, kept only for
  a client that does not know the code; `params` carries what the client needs to
  interpolate. Add a code to the runtime list first, then the route, then
  `errors.*`/`parseErrors.*` in both catalogs — `catalog.test.ts` iterates the
  list and fails otherwise. `utils/apiError.ts` is the single place a code becomes
  a message, which is why every `catch (e) { setError(e.message) }` site
  translates for free.
- **Raw SSE `error` bodies and tool-result strings are deliberately not
  translated.** The first is dynamic provider text with no code to key on; the
  second is *model input*, and translating it would change model behaviour. Both
  stay as they are — a provider failure therefore renders in the provider's
  language.
- **Language is detected, not stored, until chosen.** Absence of `gl-locale` means
  "read `navigator.languages`"; there is no `"auto"` value, unlike the theme,
  because language is chosen once rather than toggled. Anything unsupported falls
  back to English. `useLocale()` and the pre-paint script in `index.html` must
  stay in lock-step, the same obligation `theme.ts` carries.
- **SSE framing** is `event: <type>\ndata: <json>\n\n`. Chat streams via
  `reply.hijack()`; the agent emits `text` deltas, `reasoning` deltas,
  `tool_start`/`tool_end`, `usage`, `message_done`, optionally `title`, `error`,
  then `done`. The frontend expects exactly this.
- **Reasoning is display-only.** Chain of thought is persisted on the message and
  rendered, but must **never** be replayed into history — providers ignore or reject
  it. `buildHistoryMessages()` reads only `content` and `toolCalls`; keep it that way.
- **Reasoning comes off the raw SSE stream, and only from there.** `createReasoningFetch()`
  taps the fetch response and is the **single** source of chain-of-thought — do not
  "simplify" it away. Do not *also* read `chunk.additional_kwargs` in `chunkReasoning()`:
  `@langchain/openai` 1.5.x does map `reasoning_content` there, so reading both channels
  emits every delta twice and doubles the persisted `reasoning`. `chunkReasoning()` exists
  only for the content-block shape the tap cannot see. (Token usage is read from the
  step's *chunks* rather than the reduced message — `concat` does carry `usage_metadata`
  now, but the chunk scan does not depend on that staying true.)
- **Streamed text can exceed what is persisted.** On a step that emits preamble text *and*
  a tool call, the preamble is streamed as `text` deltas; when the final step produces
  content, `finalContent` is *replaced* by just that step's text. So the live view shows
  narration + answer while `messages.content` holds only the answer, and a reload drops the
  narration. Pinned by a test in `apps/server/test/agent/loop.test.ts` — changing it is a
  product decision, not a bug fix.
- **A user's title is permanent.** `session.titleSource` is `auto` until a human
  supplies a title via `PATCH /api/sessions/:id`, which flips it to `user`; the
  auto-titler must then never touch it. The titler runs on the first turn only, and
  every failure is swallowed — it must not be able to fail a chat turn.
- **History must stay user/assistant balanced.** On a chat error, a `⚠️ …`
  assistant message is persisted so the next turn's history is well-formed. An
  assistant message's `tool_calls` are only replayed into history when the
  matching results exist — OpenAI rejects the pair otherwise.
- **Schema changes need `ensureColumn`.** `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` silently
  skips existing tables, so an existing database would never gain a new column.
- **Destructive UI actions confirm first.** Session, Copilot, workspace and
  provider deletes go through `confirm()` from `composables/confirm.ts`. The
  agent's own `delete_file` tool is deliberately *not* gated.
- **Styling goes through the design system.** `docs/design-system.md` is the
  spec and `apps/web/test/style.test.ts` enforces it: a new colour lands in the
  one `:root` block *and* in both light-palette blocks, and spacing, type and
  radius come from tokens rather than literals — a `padding: 8px 12px` in a
  component fails the build. Nothing but colours is restated for the light
  theme; the guard derives that from the value, so a length or a duration needs
  no light variant and a colour cannot skip one. `--scrim` is the cautionary
  tale: it was exempted as "a black that dims rather than colours", and 0.55 of
  black over a white page composites the whole thing to `#737373`.
- **A breakpoint is a literal in two languages.** `composables/breakpoints.ts`
  holds the strings that reach `matchMedia`; `style.css` holds the same values as
  media queries, and both are pinned by tests. Change them together — a mismatch
  is a drawer that opens on a screen with no toggle.
- **Every overlay is teleported to `body`.** `position: fixed` resolves against
  the nearest *transformed* ancestor, and the mobile drawer is one, so a dialog
  left inside the sidebar renders off-screen. Relatedly, do not give `.app` a
  `transform`, `filter` or `contain`: it would become the containing block for
  the fixed sidebar and every overlay at once.
- **Responsive rules live at the end of `style.css`.** A media query does not
  raise specificity, so an override written above the rule it means to override
  loses on source order alone. This has already produced one bug: the narrow
  `position: fixed` on `.overlay-popover` silently lost to the same class
  declared further down.
- **The server serves the built frontend, and only when one exists.** `webApp.ts`
  registers `@fastify/static` at `/` *after* the API routes, conditional on an
  `index.html` being present. `buildServer` takes `webDir` and **tests never pass it** —
  whether the machine running them happens to have run `pnpm build` must not change what
  they assert. That a concrete `/api` route still wins over the static wildcard, and that
  an unknown `/api/...` still answers with Fastify's 404 envelope, are pinned in
  `apps/server/test/web-app.test.ts`.
- **The desktop server runs on Electron's Node, not a system Node.** There is no Node on
  a user's machine, so the child is spawned from `process.execPath` with
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. That is also what makes `better-sqlite3`'s prebuilt N-API
  binary the right one. Do not "simplify" it to a plain `node` invocation.
- **The panel enters `running` on exactly one signal**: the server printing
  `[guided-learning] listening on <url>`. Not a fixed port, not a timer, and not
  Fastify's own "Server listening at …" banner, which is logged from inside `listen`
  before the process is necessarily ready. A control panel that claims a server is up
  when it is not is worse than one that says nothing, because the user has no way to tell.
- **The desktop app never writes into its own bundle.** Writable state lives under
  `app.getPath("userData")`, reached through `GL_PROJECT_ROOT`; the bundle is read-only
  and is replaced wholesale on every update. First-run seeding is idempotent and **never
  overwrites** an existing `config.yaml` or overlay — that is what keeps an API key the
  user typed into the Settings UI from vanishing on the next launch.
- **`asar: false` and `npmRebuild: false` in `electron-builder.yml` are deliberate.**
  The first, because the server resolves a native addon and an ESM package from a child
  process and neither should have to go through an asar archive. The second, because
  `better-sqlite3` v13's prebuilds are N-API and therefore already ABI-correct for
  Electron. Flip `npmRebuild` only if a dependency ships a non-N-API native module.
  Rationale in full in `docs/desktop.md`.
- **Extracted document text lives in `parsed/`, never beside the bytes.** An
  attachment's derived data goes to `uploads/<sessionId>/parsed/<attachmentId>.txt`,
  not `uploads/<sessionId>/<attachmentId>.txt`. `findStoredAttachment()` globs
  `<id>.*` in the session directory and `txt` is a valid extension in the MIME table,
  so a flat sibling would let the download endpoint serve extracted text instead of
  the original PDF. Pinned by a test in `apps/server/test/documents/store.test.ts`.
- **`read_document` is scoped to the current turn's attachments.** It is bound to a
  whitelist of attachment ids, not to the uploads root, because ids are guessable and
  a bare-id tool would let a model read another session's uploads. Adding a document
  tool that takes an id without checking it against the whitelist reintroduces that.
- **A document that could not be read must never look like one that was.** An empty
  extraction is reported as `no_text_layer`, not as empty text — a model told it read
  a file it never saw will answer about it anyway. `parseStatus` on the attachment is
  what the UI renders, and the composer blocks sending until extraction has settled.
- **`pdfjs-dist` is pinned to 4.x.** 5.7+ and 6.x require Node ≥ 22.13 while
  `package.json` advertises Node ≥ 20; bumping that floor is a separate,
  user-visible change and must not ride along with an unrelated dependency update.

## Gotchas

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `allowBuilds` gates every package whose postinstall does real
  work. Without the entries it fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`. `better-sqlite3` and
  `esbuild` are native/bundler; `electron` downloads the ~130 MB binary the desktop app
  runs on. `electron-winstaller` is explicitly `false` — it is Windows-only Squirrel
  tooling, and `pnpm install` otherwise rewrites the file with a
  `set this to true or false` placeholder that is not valid YAML.
- `better-sqlite3` is a native module — it builds against your local Node. If you
  change Node versions, reinstall.
- Config loads `config/config.yaml`, overlaid by a git-ignored
  `config/config.local.yaml`, with `${ENV_VAR}` references resolved from `.env`
  + real env vars. Real env vars win over `.env`. `GL_CONFIG_PATH` swaps the
  *overlay* path, and `GL_DATA_DIR` moves the sqlite database + uploads tree —
  both exist for tests and the e2e run, and both must be set before the config
  module is first imported.
- `pnpm test:e2e` starts its own fake LLM, backend and Vite on 3898 / 3899 / 5199,
  so a `pnpm dev` instance can keep running. Its scratch data lives in the
  git-ignored `.e2e/`, removed on teardown. It bundles `apps/desktop` first, because
  `e2e/panel.spec.ts` runs against the control panel's built page.
- **`electron-builder` fetches its helper binaries from GitHub at first use, and Electron's
  binary comes from there too.** On a slow or blocked network both stall with no output at
  all, so the build looks hung rather than failing. Set the mirrors first — details in
  `docs/desktop.md` → Building from a slow network.
- `pnpm desktop:dev` runs `build.mjs --no-web`, which reuses whatever frontend is already
  staged in `dist/resources/web` and leaves it alone. Run `pnpm desktop:build` (or
  `pnpm build`) once if the panel's server has nothing to serve.
